# Random Programs Repository

This repository contains various random programs and projects that need a central storage location. These could include coding experiments, small utilities, or practice projects - just a mishmash of code that exists because... why not?

## About

A collection of miscellaneous programs and scripts that don't warrant their own repository. Perfect for quick experiments and learning exercises.

## What's Here?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

Various Python scripts and experiments. Browse around if you're curious!

## Usage

Each program should (hopefully) have its own comments or instructions. No guarantees though!

## Resources

`.gitignore` templates cuz its random langues so like there alot of these
[github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own random programs. The more random, the better. ideally in their own branch

## License

Do whatever you want with this code. I'm not responsible for anything that happens, unless stated otherwise.

## Note

This is a personal workspace for code snippets and small "projects". Code quality and documentation may vary.
